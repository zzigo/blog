## ðŸŸ¢ epiphylogenetics
co-evolution of brains and tools.
that there has never been such a thing as â€˜the humanâ€™. (+  Claire Colebrook and Kathryn Yusoff)


## cont

Epiphylogenesis presents an<mark class="hltr-yellow"> account of the genesis of the human species</mark> (also known as anthropogenesis) and human societies by means of ever more complex technical systems and<mark class="hltr-blue"> â€˜technicisedâ€™ environments</mark>. Crucially, it constitutes a more general theory of how life-forms evolve with particular socio-techno-environmental <mark class="hltr-purple">assemblages</mark>, of which <mark class="hltr-purple">anthropogenesis</mark> is then a special case.

While uncovered in a quest to understand the specificity of human evolution, this type of higherorder co-evolution â€“ by means of technics and organised (or technicised) environments â€“ is certainly not something that sets humans apart in kind, but only by degree. Alluding to all kinds of constructed environments, Stiegler himself later

used the example of the anthill: â€˜It is impossible to understand the ant without the anthill.â€™ 17 By situating (the specificity of) human environments on an evolutionary spectrum, Stiegler in fact wards off any taint of human exceptionalism. The human is fundamentally decentred as a historical construct. Epiphylogenesis â€“ as a broader process than anthropogenesis â€“ reveals that there has never been such a thing as â€˜the humanâ€™ whose genesis could be mapped in isolation, or merely â€˜in the environmentâ€™. Rather, the problem must be approached via co-evolution, which is structurally coupled to the evolving organisation of particular environments and their production of difference.
